## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Dataset Download Fails
```bash
# Solution: Configure Kaggle API
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
# Place your kaggle.json there
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```

#### ODE Integration Unstable
```python
# Solution: Adjust tolerances
rtol=1e-2  # Less strict
atol=1e-3  # Less strict
```

#### Out of Memory
```python
# Solution: Reduce batch size or model size
batch_size = 64  # Instead of 128
hidden_dim = 64  # Instead of 128
```

#### LaTeX Compilation Errors
```bash
# Solution: Ensure all packages are installed
# For Overleaf: packages are pre-installed
# For local: install texlive-full
```
